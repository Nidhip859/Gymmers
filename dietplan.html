			<h2>FAQ</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="wrapperFaq">

			<P class="headerFaq" onclick="popupFaq();">Can I pay by cash for my membership?<span>+</span> </P>
			<P class="main-text">We don't have a cash option. We have embraced innovative technology and don't have a
				reception desk at the entrance to our gym. All payments must be made automatically online or at the
				kiosks in reception, using your bank/credit card.</p>

			<P class="headerFaq" onclick="popupFaq();">Do I need to book a slot for the gym? (COVID-19
				Related)<span>+</span> </P>
			<P class="main-text">Yes. Gym slots of 75 minutes must be booked on our class timetable. There will be a
				15-minute turn over time in between gym time slots in order to give everyone enough time to leave the
				club and for the team to clean and sanitise the equipment ready for the next time slot. Slots can be
				booked up to 3 days before at 9pm. For example, to book a slot on Monday the 20th of July, you can book
				from 9pm on Friday the 17th of July. This booking system will be strictly enforced and if you have not
				booked a slot for the specific time you wish to come to the gym, you will not be granted access to the
				gym.</p>

			<P class="headerFaq" onclick="popupFaq();">Can I cancel the gym time slot I have booked?<span>+</span> </P>
			<P class="main-text">Yes, gym time slots can be cancelled up to 2 hours before their start time. If you
				don't cancel your gym time slots, and miss 3 or more within a 30 day period, a booking block will be
				placed on your account for 3 days. </p>

			<P class="headerFaq" onclick="popupFaq();">What safety/sanitisation measures have you introduced in relation
				to COVID-19? (COVID-19 Related) <span>+</span> </P>
			<P class="main-text">our member's health and safety is our number one priority. We have introduced numerous
				new safety precautions. These include every staff member and instructor having their temperature checked
				and recorded in our staff safety log before their shift, and staff will be required to wear masks and
				gloves during their shift. We have also installed multiple hand sanitising stations around the club,
				including 2 motion-activated hand sanatisers which are located as soon as you enter the gym. We have
				also invested in an electrostatic disinfectant distributor. The new disinfectant allows us to spray more
				evenly, gets hard-to-reach crevices, clings to every surface it coats, and is proven to kill viruses
				like COVID-19. Staff will use this on surfaces in all common areas every day, with special attention to
				bikes, weights, machines, and all high-touch surfaces each day. </p>

			<P class="headerFaq" onclick="popupFaq();">I have a health issue, can i still exercise?<span>+</span> </P>
			<P class="main-text">Yes, but it will depend on your condition and medical clearance may need to be provided
				by your doctor. We have specialised staff that can help you and members are regularly referred to us by
				their doctor. If you have a specific medical issue, please email the details in confidence to
				support@gymers.com. and attach a copy of your doctor/physio clearance letter to this email./p>
